<h2 id="preamble-and-planning">Preamble and Planning</h2>
<p>I’m excited for <a href="https://eli.li/december-adventure">December
Adventure</a> 2024, where I’ll code a bit every day of the month and
write about it. Last year <a
href="https://leetusman.com/december-adventure-2023">I participated</a>
and worked for a month on designing a new website. When the month ended
I hadn’t finished, and I ultimately made some different design decisions
than I experimented with. But I did use a lot of the knowledge I gained,
and I learned what I didn’t want to do as well. In particular, I made
comprehensive class-free CSS stylesheets, learned about automation with
custom templates for pandoc, and developed approaches to building
galleries with flexbox. I worked on image conversion scripts, and
accessibility. I also learned about the limitations of using markdown
and bash with variables as a templating language. All of this and much
more I put to work in the class websites I made in the spring
afterwards, and finally in my <a href="https://leetusman.com">website
redesign</a> that I completed in the spring.</p>
<p>This year, I don’t have a single project but instead a number of
little things I’m interested in exploring. I probably can’t get to all
of them. And I’ll let myself wander depending on my interests.</p>
<p>Currently, these are my ideas of things to play with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Work on an experimental narrative with recorded audio and 3d assets.
Maybe in p5/WebGL, or maybe Lua</li>
<li>Make a simple 3d environment in Godot, ideally with my own hand
drawn assets</li>
<li>Try out Construct 3 for rapid game-making</li>
<li>Try out Jeffrey’s <a
href="https://aesthetic.computer">aesthetic.computer</a>.</li>
<li>Complete my claw machine roguelike in Pico-8?</li>
<li>Work on my Forth-based Processing-like little language, using
SDL/Love2d on the backend</li>
<li>revive the PocketChip, and try to see what I can do with it with its
ancient OS</li>
<li>Install alternative firmware for my Anbernic, and try adding the
Pico-8 player to it and more roms</li>
<li>Make some class sites with Hugo, possibly with Pandoc</li>
<li>Play around with LOGO again, to prep for teaching with it in
Drawing, Moving and Seeing with Code this spring</li>
</ul>
<p>I probably will only try a small handful of these, but it’s nice to
have some options in mind.</p>
<p>Okay, I’ll be back December 1. Let’s see if I stick with this color
palette!</p>
<h2 id="nov-29">Nov 29</h2>
<p>I started early.</p>
<p>I checked out <a
href="https://lichen.commoninternet.net/">markdown-lichen</a>, a project
by online/irl friends of mine. It’s a gui wrapper around markdown-based
static CMS. I did some testing in straight php and it worked mostly fine
without being able to render built html pages. I had a chat with Max on
Masto about implementing it to work without requiring docker, apache or
nginx, since the goal is to be lightweight. They thought that should be
doable. Will come back to this project and do more tests probably at
that point. I guess I could always look into php myself but it does not
fill me with joy. I’m hoping Max implements it, then I could add in
documentation and run some tests.</p>
<p>Next I researched the <a
href="https://www.lexaloffle.com/picotron.php">Picotron fantasy
workstation</a> to see if I wanted to purchase and play around with it.
I found some cool projects, checked out the terminal, API, ran some
programs online. Ultimately, I didn’t find something to excite me enough
to work on, so I’m going to pause on that for now.</p>
<p>Next, I worked on a web project. Some colleagues are in an exhibit
opening in a month in LA and need a timebased 24-hour work to display in
a website, updating once a second, as part of a show. Consider it
something like a 24-hour long video with a framerate of 1 frame per
second. They asked if I could make it happen. I developed a simple
system and implemented a test, building out a simple site for them to
check speed, image resolution, and for us to do some testing for
robustness. Took me an hour or so for the initial test from idea to
coding to deployment. Sent it along for their feedback. I should ask
them for some money. I’ll track my time. :)</p>
<p>By the way, this mini blog is being implemented in pandoc with front
matter holding the title and css filename, and then just using a simple
incantation in the terminal to render md to html.</p>
<h2 id="dec-1">Dec 1</h2>
<p>Okay, first official day of December Adventure. It’s Sunday, and I
spent much of the day staying warm, visiting Swiss Institute to see
their current shows, and the tea shop and Ukrainian Village.</p>
<p>In the evening I decided to spend some time evaluating static site
generators and to build one up because I’ve been unhappy with jekyll.
For a decade I’ve mostly used jekyll, which has built-in support for
GitHub pages. This means it’s easy to host websites on GitHub written in
Jekyll. But every few months when I try to make a post on one of my
sites (class sites or project sites) I run into a problem and the site
won’t build due to dependency hell from some combo of Ruby, gems, or
bundler dependencies. I don’t want to use any of these. I’ve put
checking out hugo on the back burner for a while, so now felt like a
good time to spend a little time with it.</p>
<p>I tried it in 2017, wasn’t immediately noticing it to be much
superior to jekyll, and haven’t tried it out since but every time I
complain about jekyll someone recommends hugo. So I checked it out!
Unfortunately, to make a new site I have to invest time to figuring out
directory structure, configuring templating and themes. And like Jekyll,
it has many variables, and such to learn and implement. I know it’s
probably faster than building my own site from scratch but I got turned
off. I didn’t want to learn the hugo way.</p>
<p>So next I fired Eleventy/11ty static site builder, and I check out
the starter example on glitch.com. Based on this starter, the structure
is pretty clear. The default nunjucks templating can be switched out for
liquid templating, which might make it easier to switch. I do have to
say I’m not thrilled about npm/node.js here as I fear there could be the
typcial npm ecosystem of pulling in a million dependencies, and again
dependency / version hell, though npx is to try to prevent this I guess.
But based on being a retrogrouch I next pulled up bashblog, a ssg
written in pure Bash. It’s fine, though it spends a lot of lines adding
in google analytics, disqus and twitter stuff, among other things I do
not need or want. I also find the code hard to read since it’s bash. And
the default theme is ugly, and the project creator abandoned it, so
maybe it wasn’t great?</p>
<p>To make a long story longer after all that I returned to my own
custom bash and pandoc-based static site generator, panblog, which I
started years ago. I had extracted minimal parts for powering this mini
december-adventure site for example, so this was the kick in the pants
to complete it, completing a build script, adding in theming,
permalinks, index page builder, and auto-adding headers/footers, and rss
feed generation. These are all things I already can do, so just need to
automate it intelligently.</p>
<p>So I picked up where I had left off working last time I touched the
repo. Thankfully, I’m pretty good with documentation and left lots of
notes. I decided to make some assumptions, but allow things to be easily
changed. There is a config.conf file that holds the sub-directories for:
themes, which are just css files; posts, which are markdown files with
YYYY-MM-DD-name.md naming scheme; assets, the image assets source
directory; templates, a folder holding html templates for pandoc to
convert md to html for different kinds of pages; and some variables for
holding the site name and url, for example.</p>
<p>My build script creates a site folder if needed. It loops through the
posts folder of markdown files, extracting the name and the date
separately, via hacky regexes that took me a while to get right. My
build script adds the post name and a link to the post page, inside its
own directory, to the index page. It then adds the extracted date. It
does this in reverse order so the most recent blog posts are at the top
of the index. It uses pandoc to convert each post and the index page
from markdown to html. I also set up a separate assets folder to hold
images. Next steps are to add back in page conversion for non-blog
pages, and then to test and automate the rss feed generator. Then to
make sure I have some couple good basic and different classless themes.
If all goes well, I think this could become my new static site generator
for my uni classes, and maybe for my sites in general, and then maybe a
good tool for other folks to use as well. It threads the needle between
basic markdown to html conversion with straight pandoc on the one end
and an overly complex ssg like hugo on the other. I think it’s well on
the way.</p>

<h2 id="dec-2">Dec 2</h2>
<p>Added a lot to my <a
href="https://tildegit.org/exquisitecorp/panblog">panblog</a> static
site generator including a comprehensive build script, configs error
checking, page rendering system, and documentation. I did a variety of
tests and found a few bugs I still have to crack but am in overall good
shape.</p>

<h2 id="dec-3">Dec 3</h2>
<p>Much of the day has been consumed by me sitting on a couch with a
laptop open and trying to crank out a professional document I have
agreed to write, outside of my job but in keeping with the expectations
of academia, to support faculty at another institution. It is not due
until next Monday but the institution keeps asking me for it, so I’m
trying to knock it out. Unfortunately it’s been to the detriment to
finishing up squashing bug on panblog.</p>
<p>Anyway…I did get some time to work on it. So far I removed some old
build scripts, tested my non-post page generation a bit, then added in
some build automation to include opengraph (og:meta) tags, though ran
into some issues when trying to populate the opengraph tags.</p>
<p>Next I spent some time researching both metadata and front matter <a
href="https://pandoc.org/chunkedhtml-demo/6.2-variables.html">variables</a>
in pandoc, with the goal to automate pulling a og:image url from
frontmatter . I think I found a solution through the
<code>--metadata KEY[=VAL]</code> option or the front matter, and
finally found a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/26490978">good
explanation on stackoverflow</a>, that I think will be useful and I plan
to use that to try to knock out remaining needs for populating
variables. I also see useful info in the extensive man page
<code>man pandoc</code> in the TEMPLATES section and then in
Conditionals, which I think will be useful for testing if an image is
set and then assigning the og:image metadata if it is.</p>
<p>Lastly for panblog, I began to rework gmi.css to an alternate “good
defaults” new theme to ship with panblog. First, I checked out <a
href="https://lospec.com/palette-list">2-color palletes</a> from the
Lospec website, and began trying some options, building out a new
starter theme fresh.css.</p>
<p>Also, separately, I squashed a bug on <a
href="https://leetusman.com/archiving-artist-spaces/">Archiving
Artist-Run Spaces</a> and added a redirect to my main/portfolio website
in the /projects sub-directory in case anyone tries to manually go there
directly (instead of to a project directly) so they are re-routed to
root, which is the actual portfolio landing page, instead of a 404.</p>

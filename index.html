<h2 id="preamble-and-planning">Preamble and Planning</h2>
<p>I’m excited for <a href="https://eli.li/december-adventure">December
Adventure</a> 2024, where I’ll code a bit every day of the month and
write about it. Last year <a
href="https://leetusman.com/december-adventure-2023">I participated</a>
and worked for a month on designing a new website. When the month ended
I hadn’t finished, and I ultimately made some different design decisions
than I experimented with. But I did use a lot of the knowledge I gained,
and I learned what I didn’t want to do as well. In particular, I made
comprehensive class-free CSS stylesheets, learned about automation with
custom templates for pandoc, and developed approaches to building
galleries with flexbox. I worked on image conversion scripts, and
accessibility. I also learned about the limitations of using markdown
and bash with variables as a templating language. All of this and much
more I put to work in the class websites I made in the spring
afterwards, and finally in my <a href="https://leetusman.com">website
redesign</a> that I completed in the spring.</p>
<p>This year, I don’t have a single project but instead a number of
little things I’m interested in exploring. I probably can’t get to all
of them. And I’ll let myself wander depending on my interests.</p>
<p>Currently, these are my ideas of things to play with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Work on an experimental narrative with recorded audio and 3d assets.
Maybe in p5/WebGL, or maybe Lua</li>
<li>Make a simple 3d environment in Godot, ideally with my own hand
drawn assets</li>
<li>Try out Construct 3 for rapid game-making</li>
<li>Try out Jeffrey’s <a
href="https://aesthetic.computer">aesthetic.computer</a>.</li>
<li>Complete my claw machine roguelike in Pico-8?</li>
<li>Work on my Forth-based Processing-like little language, using
SDL/Love2d on the backend</li>
<li>revive the PocketChip, and try to see what I can do with it with its
ancient OS</li>
<li>Install alternative firmware for my Anbernic, and try adding the
Pico-8 player to it and more roms</li>
<li>Make some class sites with Hugo, possibly with Pandoc</li>
<li>Play around with LOGO again, to prep for teaching with it in
Drawing, Moving and Seeing with Code this spring</li>
</ul>
<p>I probably will only try a small handful of these, but it’s nice to
have some options in mind.</p>
<p>Okay, I’ll be back December 1. Let’s see if I stick with this color
palette!</p>
<h2 id="nov-29">Nov 29</h2>
<p>I started early.</p>
<p>I checked out <a
href="https://lichen.commoninternet.net/">markdown-lichen</a>, a project
by online/irl friends of mine. It’s a gui wrapper around markdown-based
static CMS. I did some testing in straight php and it worked mostly fine
without being able to render built html pages. I had a chat with Max on
Masto about implementing it to work without requiring docker, apache or
nginx, since the goal is to be lightweight. They thought that should be
doable. Will come back to this project and do more tests probably at
that point. I guess I could always look into php myself but it does not
fill me with joy. I’m hoping Max implements it, then I could add in
documentation and run some tests.</p>
<p>Next I researched the <a
href="https://www.lexaloffle.com/picotron.php">Picotron fantasy
workstation</a> to see if I wanted to purchase and play around with it.
I found some cool projects, checked out the terminal, API, ran some
programs online. Ultimately, I didn’t find something to excite me enough
to work on, so I’m going to pause on that for now.</p>
<p>Next, I worked on a web project. Some colleagues are in an exhibit
opening in a month in LA and need a timebased 24-hour work to display in
a website, updating once a second, as part of a show. Consider it
something like a 24-hour long video with a framerate of 1 frame per
second. They asked if I could make it happen. I developed a simple
system and implemented a test, building out a simple site for them to
check speed, image resolution, and for us to do some testing for
robustness. Took me an hour or so for the initial test from idea to
coding to deployment. Sent it along for their feedback. I should ask
them for some money. I’ll track my time. :)</p>
<p>By the way, this mini blog is being implemented in pandoc with front
matter holding the title and css filename, and then just using a simple
incantation in the terminal to render md to html.</p>
<h2 id="dec-1">Dec 1</h2>
<p>Okay, first official day of December Adventure. It’s Sunday, and I
spent much of the day staying warm, visiting Swiss Institute to see
their current shows, and the tea shop and Ukrainian Village.</p>
<p>In the evening I decided to spend some time evaluating static site
generators and to build one up because I’ve been unhappy with jekyll.
For a decade I’ve mostly used jekyll, which has built-in support for
GitHub pages. This means it’s easy to host websites on GitHub written in
Jekyll. But every few months when I try to make a post on one of my
sites (class sites or project sites) I run into a problem and the site
won’t build due to dependency hell from some combo of Ruby, gems, or
bundler dependencies. I don’t want to use any of these. I’ve put
checking out hugo on the back burner for a while, so now felt like a
good time to spend a little time with it.</p>
<p>I tried it in 2017, wasn’t immediately noticing it to be much
superior to jekyll, and haven’t tried it out since but every time I
complain about jekyll someone recommends hugo. So I checked it out!
Unfortunately, to make a new site I have to invest time to figuring out
directory structure, configuring templating and themes. And like Jekyll,
it has many variables, and such to learn and implement. I know it’s
probably faster than building my own site from scratch but I got turned
off. I didn’t want to learn the hugo way.</p>
<p>So next I fired Eleventy/11ty static site builder, and I check out
the starter example on glitch.com. Based on this starter, the structure
is pretty clear. The default nunjucks templating can be switched out for
liquid templating, which might make it easier to switch. I do have to
say I’m not thrilled about npm/node.js here as I fear there could be the
typcial npm ecosystem of pulling in a million dependencies, and again
dependency / version hell, though npx is to try to prevent this I guess.
But based on being a retrogrouch I next pulled up bashblog, a ssg
written in pure Bash. It’s fine, though it spends a lot of lines adding
in google analytics, disqus and twitter stuff, among other things I do
not need or want. I also find the code hard to read since it’s bash. And
the default theme is ugly, and the project creator abandoned it, so
maybe it wasn’t great?</p>
<p>To make a long story longer after all that I returned to my own
custom bash and pandoc-based static site generator, panblog, which I
started years ago. I had extracted minimal parts for powering this mini
december-adventure site for example, so this was the kick in the pants
to complete it, completing a build script, adding in theming,
permalinks, index page builder, and auto-adding headers/footers, and rss
feed generation. These are all things I already can do, so just need to
automate it intelligently.</p>
<p>So I picked up where I had left off working last time I touched the
repo. Thankfully, I’m pretty good with documentation and left lots of
notes. I decided to make some assumptions, but allow things to be easily
changed. There is a config.conf file that holds the sub-directories for:
themes, which are just css files; posts, which are markdown files with
YYYY-MM-DD-name.md naming scheme; assets, the image assets source
directory; templates, a folder holding html templates for pandoc to
convert md to html for different kinds of pages; and some variables for
holding the site name and url, for example.</p>
<p>My build script creates a site folder if needed. It loops through the
posts folder of markdown files, extracting the name and the date
separately, via hacky regexes that took me a while to get right. My
build script adds the post name and a link to the post page, inside its
own directory, to the index page. It then adds the extracted date. It
does this in reverse order so the most recent blog posts are at the top
of the index. It uses pandoc to convert each post and the index page
from markdown to html. I also set up a separate assets folder to hold
images. Next steps are to add back in page conversion for non-blog
pages, and then to test and automate the rss feed generator. Then to
make sure I have some couple good basic and different classless themes.
If all goes well, I think this could become my new static site generator
for my uni classes, and maybe for my sites in general, and then maybe a
good tool for other folks to use as well. It threads the needle between
basic markdown to html conversion with straight pandoc on the one end
and an overly complex ssg like hugo on the other. I think it’s well on
the way.</p>

<h2 id="dec-2">Dec 2</h2>
<p>Added a lot to my <a
href="https://tildegit.org/exquisitecorp/panblog">panblog</a> static
site generator including a comprehensive build script, configs error
checking, page rendering system, and documentation. I did a variety of
tests and found a few bugs I still have to crack but am in overall good
shape.</p>
<h2 id="dec-3">Dec 3</h2>
<p>Much of the day has been consumed by me sitting on a couch with a
laptop open and trying to crank out a professional document I have
agreed to write, outside of my job but in keeping with the expectations
of academia, to support faculty at another institution. It is not due
until next Monday but the institution keeps asking me for it, so I’m
trying to knock it out. Unfortunately it’s been to the detriment to
finishing up squashing bug on panblog.</p>
<p>Anyway…I did get some time to work on it. So far I removed some old
build scripts, tested my non-post page generation a bit, then added in
some build automation to include opengraph (og:meta) tags, though ran
into some issues when trying to populate the opengraph tags.</p>
<p>Next I spent some time researching both metadata and front matter <a
href="https://pandoc.org/chunkedhtml-demo/6.2-variables.html">variables</a>
in pandoc, with the goal to automate pulling a og:image url from
frontmatter . I think I found a solution through the
<code>--metadata KEY[=VAL]</code> option or the front matter, and
finally found a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/26490978">good
explanation on stackoverflow</a>, that I think will be useful and I plan
to use that to try to knock out remaining needs for populating
variables. I also see useful info in the extensive man page
<code>man pandoc</code> in the TEMPLATES section and then in
Conditionals, which I think will be useful for testing if an image is
set and then assigning the og:image metadata if it is.</p>
<p>Lastly for panblog, I began to rework gmi.css to an alternate “good
defaults” new theme to ship with panblog. First, I checked out <a
href="https://lospec.com/palette-list">2-color palletes</a> from the
Lospec website, and began trying some options, building out a new
starter theme fresh.css.</p>
<p>Also, separately, I squashed a bug on <a
href="https://leetusman.com/archiving-artist-spaces/">Archiving
Artist-Run Spaces</a> and added a redirect to my main/portfolio website
in the /projects sub-directory in case anyone tries to manually go there
directly (instead of to a project directly) so they are re-routed to
root, which is the actual portfolio landing page, instead of a 404.</p>
<h2 id="dec-4">Dec 4</h2>
<p>Today I had meetings and taught my Programming Games class. Next week
is the end of the semester so today I made a playtesting/coding day and
the Learning Assistant and I went around meeting with students to help
them squash bugs. We also talked about difficulty in games and tuning
your game mechanics, and looked at examples of that across a few genres.
The student projects are generally pretty great. I gave them the option
of using Pico-8 or Love2d so there are lots of different kinds of
projects, from platformers with bizarre mechanics, to race games, to
experimental first person adventure stories. The biggest challenges my
intro students deal with are writing collision detection for enemies,
hazards, pickups, etc. The biggest challenge my advanced students have
is reigning in their ambitious ideas that would take months of work and
helping them shape a smaller, more doable multi-week project with the
time allotted. I don’t want to punish them for being ambitious, so
usually I’ll see if they can make just the first level, or a smaller
component of their more ambitious game idea. This is especially
important since they don’t know to playtest and iterate and would tend
to work in their head and solo until they finish, delivering a complete
game before ever having another person try it out.</p>

</figure>
<p>One of the senior students needed some extra credits so I asked him
to work on a project this semester to build out a “bartop” arcade
cabinet for student games. He made it out of plywood I purchased from
the hardware store, and we ordered buttons and a controller from the
internet. Then we raided my office stockpile of dumpstered keyboards,
mice, monitors, etc that I’ve scavenged over the years, and used a
Raspberry Pi from our spring <a
href="https://leetusman.com/tinycomputing_spring2024/">Special Projects
in Tiny Computing</a> class. He installed RetroPie and Emulation Station
and brought the nearly-finished machine, but we need to install Pico-8
and get EmulationStation to play it. I followed a <a
href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RetroPie/comments/lurmu0/pico8_in_retropie_easy_uptodate_tutorial_with/">tutorial
of sorts</a> I found on reddit that seemed fairly comprehensive. First I
had to escape out of EmulationStation and boot to the console. Hooking
up Wifi on campus is a tedious process on campus involving registering
the machine, visiting Campus Technology Services and the like. Rather
than deal, I just plugged in directly to an ethernet port and got
internet the ol’-fashioned way. I updated the computer, which took 15
minutes on the Pi, and then installed Vim so I could edit files. I
downloaded some helper scripts from the tutorial onto my own laptop and
installed them on one of my server spaces, then used wget in the
terminal on the Pi to download and place them in the right places. I
need to figure out how overscan works as I can’t see the edge of the
screen and thus it’s hard to edit in the terminal. I don’t have a
regular GUI installed and didn’t feel like going through the whole
rigamorole to get that going, so I did my best to edit and tab around to
see what I was typing, but mistakes were made! Eventually, all was well
and I got Pico-8 to boot up. I couldn’t quite figure out how the student
had configured the controllers and they weren’t working as I expected,
so we’ll plan to meet up tomorrow to try to finish up the controller
scheme.</p>
<p>Finally, to procrastinate on finishing up the colleague review letter
I worked on panblog a bit and continued hacking on a nice starter css
theme for blogposts and index pages. I made a little test trying out a
modification of a basic theme I started for a class website I taught in
the spring. It’s probably a bit “too much” for the out of the box theme
but it would be nice to ship a few themes that are basically tiny css
files since I feel most static site generators add that extra friction
that you need to find themes and configure them when it could be as easy
as just changing a single theme name in the front matter of a blogpost
or page.</p>

<h2 id="dec-5">Dec 5</h2>
<p>Had our next-to-last Programming for Visual Artists class today. I
showed students how to use CSS to affect the canvas, and how p5 fits
into the rest of the browser ecosystem. I also showed them Processing in
more detail, and when and how you may want to use it. For the rest of
class students were given time to work on their final project due next
week so I did lots of 1-on-1 meetings with students, debugging, talking
through coding and conceptual ideas.</p>
<p>After class I met with J to get the controllers working on the arcade
cabinet, which involves a lot of Bash scripts, configuration files and
physical hardware. First I quickly cleaned up through a Bash script and
some config files how Pico-8 works through EmulationStation. This will
allow us to use EmulationStation as the back-end launcher so that in the
future we can launch multiple game systems, and no keyboard required.
Then we thought we were on a streak but we ended up spending 3 1/2 hours
trying to get the darn 2 player joysticks and buttons mapped to the
hardware correctly. Unfortunately we kept having weird problems like
left/right being up/down, then we had left and right switched. Then we
tried to fix it and I kid you not, the A button was now right joystick,
seemingly at random. What a nightmare. The only good guide to
configuring controllers we found and that seemed to work was on the <a
href="https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?tid=38841">BBS forum</a>. But
eventually J found that a wire had fallen off the controller, and after
reconnecting that, it solved one thing but we found we had other
problems. We tried switching out controllers, swapping cables,
un-connecting and reconnecting things, but each solution seemed to cause
problems elsewhere. We guessed there is an intermittent short somewhere
but lacked the energy to keep going because at that point, we’d put
hours in and our brains were getting tired. So after all that time
rather than leave defeated we got single player controller to work and
will just have that mode ready for next week during final game
presentation and arcade night, as I don’t have time to work at school on
this til the day of presentations. During the winter or spring we’ll
meet up again and try to get the second player controller working, and
finally install the machine in the Lab. I’m a bit disapointed we aren’t
finished but it will be okay for next week because I think everyone
turned in solo games for the Pico-8 assignment.</p>
<p>Aside from coding and teaching I also spent about 2 1/2 hours on the
train and at home polishing up my letter of recommendation for a
colleague and submitted it. I have to do 3 more (but easier) ones
tomorrow!</p>
<h2 id="dec-6">Dec 6</h2>
<p>I think I got 90% of the MVP for panblog static site generator done.
It’s working well now, and I think the main thing left is to add correct
OG:meta image variables and some project documentation, then start using
panblog. What I have is a static site generator similar to others such
as Jekyll and 11ty and Hugo, but simpler, with less variables and
dependencies and the like, but fast. There is a single config.conf file
where you put metadata such as website title, assets folder, site output
folder, themes folder. There is a templates folder holding the site
landing page and individual posts html template files. There are
templates for header.html and footer.html files. You add posts to the
posts folder in YYYY-MM-DD-name.md format, and use a standard markdown
with frontmatter template. Images get checked in an images assets folder
and on a post page you just write the image filename. After putting your
post pages in the posts folder you just run the build.sh script to build
the site. That’s it! It’s late so will have to get back to it tomorrow
perhaps to finish the final details, but the todo seems not so bad:
populating Opengraph image tag via frontmatter (might be tricky,
hopefully not), adding conversion of non-blog pages (trivial), and then
adding some documentation (fun). Finally, I’ll want to see if I can
build all my spring class websites using it quickly (3 sites). At some
point I’ll hopefully add in an image gallery template page and a project
page template page as well from my website portfolio. Feels good getting
to this point, and it uses knowledge I gained from my December Adventure
time last year, then building the Archiving Artist-Run Sites project
site and my website this summer.</p>
<h2 id="dec-7">Dec 7</h2>
<p>After a fun day out at the orchestra, then to see some sound art,
then to dinner in Chinatown I came home. My partner wanted to see a
movie I wasn’t keen on so I put a few hours into panblog. It feels
pretty close to completion for an alpha release. First, I fixed a number
of bugs. Now, frontmatter is entirely optional. By default, the filename
(e.g. <em>YYYY-MM-DD-a-title.md</em>) will be tokenized into a title and
date, and all posts use the default site theme css file specified in the
config.conf file. Optionally, other things can be set in the
front-matter including: post title, theme to override the site default
theme, an opengraph image url, and an opengraph description. Later, I
may also add categories too and make an optional category page. I don’t
think it would be very difficult but I don’t know if I need it, so maybe
won’t worry about that for my alpha release. Annoyingly, I spent over an
hour or two trying to implement frontmatter custom variables with lua
filters, bash, and then finally realized they’re already implemented!
It’s just not well-documented in pandoc docs and I figured it out by
perusing Pandoc’s Issues on GitHub that they are already implemented and
I just needed to use special syntax within my custom templates. I’ve
updated my TODOs and see that the main thing left is testing: check that
the RSS generator is generating a good RSS page; check that the rendered
websites all work (need to try with other test sites). There may be a
need to minorly debug the images asset folder if switching from
title/index.html permalink to title.html. Speaking of which, uh oh,
should I actually place all posts into an output posts folder? Otherwise
they’ll clog the output rendered site root directory. This would move
them to _site_folder/posts/post_name/index.html for each. Well, I’ll
have to run some tests and see. Basically, I’ll try to do a few tests on
my own of these issues, make some sites, then announce and see if
friends will test as well. I’m feeling good about where I’m at on this.
It’s at 99% of what I currently use Jekyll for.</p>
<h2 id="dec-8">Dec 8</h2>
<p>As I woke up this morning I dawdled in bed and read other folks’ logs
of December Adventure. From there I sailed from link to link and
eventually landed on the blog of someone writing about Hugo, and then
linking to its <a
href="https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/">quickstart</a>.
Let me apologize to Hugo that I now see the Quickstart is mostly
straightforward and if I had seen it the first time without the ananke
theme added I might have made a different choice just to go with it. For
example, <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/smol/">smol</a> theme
seems to have 90% of what I’m looking for and no CSS pre-processor. It
includes header/footer template code, though I’m not sure what calls it.
And it’s missing RSS, which I’m guessing is a tutorial somewhere else.
So overall, a tutorial for Hugo quickstart but using smol theme and RSS,
and some explanation or simplification of the header/footer would get to
about where I’m at. It also has tags. I am far enough along that I’m not
going to turn back now, because mine feels fairly feature-complete and
mine is 200 lines and hugo, who knows, but probably in the tens of
thousands of lines and a dozen or two build files. In any case, the
advantages of Hugo within my own areas of focus: the option of mega more
add-on features from external add-ons (though this is where things tend
to get complicated, in my experience); an executable hugo file rather
than pandoc being update via package management for example; image
processing (to webp) in the extended edition, whatever edition means,
though I could add imagemagick for processing easily. Okay, last I’ll
mention of hugo for now.</p>
<p>Next I worked on my RSS feed generator. By the way, I’ll bookmark
this helpful stackoverflow answer on <a
href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26395374/what-can-i-control-with-yaml-header-options-in-pandoc">yaml
metadata in pandoc</a> as its key to how I’m doing templating variables
in panblog. When I need to grab a variable outside of a template I am
using grep, like this:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co"># check if file has optional title in frontmatter</span></span>
<span id="cb1-2"><a href="#cb1-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="va">post_name</span><span class="op">=</span><span class="va">$(</span><span class="fu">grep</span> <span class="at">-oP</span> <span class="st">&#39;(?&lt;=title: ).*&#39;</span> <span class="va">$file)</span></span>
<span id="cb1-3"><a href="#cb1-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="cf">if</span> <span class="bu">[</span> <span class="ot">-z</span> <span class="st">&quot;</span><span class="va">$post_name</span><span class="st">&quot;</span> <span class="bu">]</span><span class="kw">;</span> <span class="cf">then</span> <span class="co">#no title given, strip from filename</span></span>
<span id="cb1-4"><a href="#cb1-4" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>  <span class="va">post_name</span><span class="op">=</span><span class="st">&quot;</span><span class="va">${file_name</span><span class="op">//</span><span class="ss">-</span><span class="op">/</span> <span class="va">}</span><span class="st">&quot;</span> <span class="co">#replace hyphen with space in name</span></span>
<span id="cb1-5"><a href="#cb1-5" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="cf">fi</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Next I ran tests on my RSS generator and though it validated through
the w3 validator I thought I’d tweak it a bit. I pull in the title name
or generate from filename, using code similar to the above codeblock.
Then I added in guid for each post for best practices, but it’s the same
as a post url. I examined my generated rss file and it looked good. Then
I ran it through the w3 validator again. All appears good.</p>

<p>Then I took a good long break and biked to Pioneerworks for the Press
Play fair. Easily a couple thousand people there. I bought a sticker and
some zines and mixtapes, and ran into a ton of friends. I saw Sam and
Tega’s open studio and caught up with them on Solar Protocol and their
current projects. At night I came back and decided to fire up panblog to
build a site. I started by copying my previous course website for
Creating User Interfaces, which I last taught 2 years ago and have to
teach this coming spring. It was easy to get the site up. I added in
empty directories that panblog requires, posts, themes, templates,
images; then copied over the build script, config.conf, and a css theme.
I edited config.conf with my site URL, title and theme. I moved images
over to the images directory. I edited the header and footer template
lightly, changing out a line. Then I played around with CSS, and
then…moment of truth…fired the build script up. Lovely! It works the
first time! Fast. I noticed a minor bug, that the header wasn’t included
on the post_template and I fixed it on this site, plus went back and
fixed it on panblog too. I decided I wanted the posts on this site to
render from oldest on top to newest at the bottom, so I followed my own
instructions to uncomment that option on the build script and commenting
out the other way. It worked like a charm.</p>
<p>Then I played around with the CSS, running build each time I made a
change, and it worked fast and easily. I’m pretty happy with how
everything turned out. See below pictures of the render site. Note: I
added a drafts directory and moved all of the posts except for week1
into that. The drafts folder has no bearing on the rendering, so it’s a
fine way to hide stuff for later. Idea borrowed from other static
generators. I’m not implementing something like “–build-drafts” or
whatever. I never use that since it’s easier to just check into posts
folder when it’s ready to test and build.</p>

<p>I’m feeling pretty great about this. I’ll come back and do another
site test for something different later, then announce and get friends
to try it out, and then spread the word. It’s great I’ve built this
tool, something I’ve felt I’ve needed for years. Goodbye Jekyll! (Well,
except for the two big projects I’ve built that rely on it and I’m not
sure I want to switch them now because they rely on Liquid Templating.
But one day, if I have to!)</p>
<h2 id="dec-9">Dec 9</h2>
<p>Today I prepped and pushed a v0.1alpha release of panblog. As it’s
pretty late at night, I’ll try to announce to friends starting tomorrow
and see if they want to try it out. I’ve also published a <a
href="https://exquisitecorp.tildepages.org/panblog-demo/">demo site</a>,
built using the the panblog repo “out of the box”. In prep for that I
pushed some fixes to build.sh, cleaned up the css template, and updated
the demo posts with some additional text. Then I spent a little time
reading up on hosting via <a
href="https://tilde.wiki/Tildepages">tildepages</a>. It was pretty easy,
but I did post the site to a separate repo to keep my original panblog
software and the output separate (and because the panblog repo pushes
the site to _site folder and I don’t see a way on tildegit to specify a
subdirectory the way you can on GitHub pages).</p>
<p>Earlier in the afternoon I worked on the timelapse website for my
colleagues and built another test page for them to check out. It’s like
a very low, very slow flipbook, one image a second, all day, of plants
germinating, growing. I will be taking a 24 hour video, converting it to
still images, one per second, pegged to the exact hour:minute:second in
the day. I decided to do this with front-end only and implemented an
async promises approach to image-load. I don’t have any previous
experience with promises so looked at some examples and then tried to
implement the idea myself. I used test video rendered to stills via
ffmpeg for the test site I built. Now that the test site works the next
step is to build the final site. I’ll need to grab the huge
multi-gigabyte video file and chop it up through ffmpeg and name the
files based on HH-MM-ss. I may need some shell scripting to output each
frame with the correct filenaming schema. Then I’ll have to modify my
code a bit. Finally, there is supposed to be a poem, some overlaid text
on top of the image files so some CSS wrangling for that, especially if
the site needs to work on mobile. I think I’ll get back to this project
next week after the semester ends.</p>
<p>In the evening I went to one of the book release events for Nick
Montfort and Lillyan-Yvonne Bertram’s (editors) anthology book OUTPUT
which is a compilation of generated texts spanning from 1953 - 2023.</p>
<p>Tomorrow I need to get back to working on the computational art
website Random Walk that I’m building out with student artwork.</p>
<h2 id="dec-10">Dec 10</h2>
<p>A little coding today. I was working with a student on a project and
we needed to figure out a flashlight-type effect where moving the mouse
around illuminates hidden items in a dark scene. I tested out the mask
procedure that’s been added to p5 since I had last checked. But the way
it works in an additive fashion didn’t mesh well with how I was
approaching it at first and I couldn’t immediately get the specific
result I wanted to get. So I quickly plunged into a bit of a brute force
approach and I figured out a fake masking effect by creating a black
opaque image twice as wide and twice as high as the screen dimensions,
with a transparent circle in the center. This gets centered and drawn on
screen at the coordinates of mouseX,mouseY. Moving that around as the
player moves around illuminates the scene. Optionally, I could have the
whole scene covered in complete darkness and switch to the one with the
hole only when pressing down the mouse. I don’t know if I’ll need this
again but it was a fun little test.</p>
<figure>
<img src="assets/img/random.jpg" alt="Random Walk screenshot" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Random Walk screenshot</figcaption>

<p>In the evening, I prepped the <a
href="https://randomwalk.club/">Random Walk</a> website to be ready for
public release. Random Walk is my now online journal of computational
art, inspired by <a href="https://taper.badquar.to">Taper</a>, <a
href="https://oral.pub/">Oral.pub</a> and the <a
href="https://thehtml.review/">HTML Review</a>. In the first
<em>issue</em> of Random Walk I published work from the students of my
intro course Programming for Visual Artists. This is a class for
students with no previous background in programming. They get a math
credit, and I teach them how to make art with code. Of course we do
cover all the basics from variables and functions to loops,
conditionals, arrays, and objects, a graphics pipeline, working with
media and sound. All that and fluxus, Yoko Ono, to the experiments at
Bell Labs, to early net art and contemporary new media artists that work
with code as medium. The idea for the online journal came to me last
month when the students were giving presentations on their work and I
was impressed by their work and what they had to say about it. I thought
creating a website inspired by these other online journals could make a
nice framing device, and I coded up most of the site around the
Thanksgiving break. As well, I hope this site provides me some
flexibility for future online computational art issues, perhaps from my
Purchase College community, or perhaps beyond.</p>
<h2 id="dec-11">Dec 11</h2>
<p>Most of the day I was at school. I had a meeting and then set up and
then an end-of-semester games night where we showed all new games by
students in my intro Programming Games class and the upper level class
Experimental Game Lab. At first I didn’t think the students would show
or that we’d have much of an audience. It was pouring rain all day. But
the students did come, they set up with me, put out their games in an
arcade-like arrangement I set up. We also revealed the new game arcade
cabinet made by the senior doing an independent study with me. I was
able to get some funding to order pizza and seltzer so that was nice to
feed everyone. It had a arcade-in-the-art-gallery feel.</p>
<p>In the evening I wasn’t sure what I wanted to work on so I re-read my
week 1 notes and decided to pick up working again on this 3d webgl
project. I don’t fully have the language for it, but it’s intended to be
something like an experimental narrative work to present in an
exhibition. I have a 3d model of a head I built out of basic shapes and
some objects in a WEBGL environment I coded in p5.js that I coded about
2 years ago for an exhibition. I went back into it and turned it into a
class so I could make several heads, at different points in space, with
their mouths synced to different playing audio. I have drawings as
textures on the models, so the head is a psychedelic-looking digital
avatar. I have recorded an interview with my mom after Thanksgiving: a
conversation on the family history of our name, which functions as a
conversation about assimilation, feminism religion, culture, values and
family. That’s a ton of issues tied in, and it’s why I wanted to work on
this for a long time. In the next few days I want to get a prototype up
of our conversation, with our digital heads speaking our recorded dialog
to each other. Where our heads are made of my drawings, but of what
these drawings should be, I’m not at present 100% sure. Our digital
lips, which I created from torus shapes, sync with our dialog. I would
have preferred to port everything over to Love2d but I wasn’t sure if
it’d be too much effort. I realized tonight as I was wrapping for the
night that I should check out <a
href="https://github.com/groverburger/g3d">g3d</a> (groverburger’s 3d
engine) a bit more and decide whether it could work or if I should
continue with p5.js or maybe Processing. I don’t think I’m making a
web-based work, so a stable desktop environment would be preferable.
Also, the browser is sometimes having a memory error. I don’t know if
it’s because of the size of the audio files I’m working with, and those
could probably be cleaned up, or a 3d model/texture issue from WEBGL.
I’ll have to look more into that potentially. But I bet Processing or
Love2d wouldn’t have the same issues if it’s a memory issue. Anyway,
something to work on. An art piece to explore. That should be a fun for
me, as I have enough of an idea to spark some experiments, but not all
the pieces yet.</p>
<h2 id="dec-12">Dec 12</h2>
<p>I taught my last class Programming for Visual Artists for the
semester today. Students gave presentations of their final projects.
Some of them were really great. Most put in good effort and made work to
be proud of. We did a critique that took a few hours, and said our
goodbyes. I’ll see them in the spring.</p>
<p>At night I put in a little time checking out the g3d library for
Love2d. I downloaded the demo scene and it runs straightup and the code
is clear. I tried importing the objects (hair, traffic cone) from my p5
project I worked on last night. I couldn’t get it to run. I went to the
g3d wiki, which is pretty short, but it clearly says I need to export
the obj objects as “triangulated” and suggested I use Blender to export
it. It’s just a simple checkbox. I wasn’t sure if I needed to rotate or
scale the object and just left the defaults for now. I then imported and
found it worked. It helped that I was basing things off a 3d model of
the planets and I’m trying to make a round head.</p>
<p>Here’s a screenshot of hair, textured with my digital drawings,
floating at an angle in space! I’ll try out more soon.</p>

<h2 id="dec-13">Dec 13</h2>
<p>I did not code today but I thought about coding. Instead I did some
school work, got a covid shot, and went to a magazine release
party/performance/reading and then a party at a friend’s loft. I got
home and didn’t feel like coding and instead listened to field
recordings / experimental music on <a
href="https://cashmereradio.com/shows/biesentales/">Biesentales
Radio</a> / Cashmere Radio. I thought about my experiments with g3d
yesterday and currently I think it probably makes the most sense to keep
going with its p5.js incarnation that I already started first, rather
than try to port the thing to Love2d and get stuck in the weeds. What
I’ll probably do is keep working with the p5 project as is and complete
the initial idea in my head, since it’s not far off. Treat that as a
prototype and see if the story and project feel like they’re working
out. It may work, or may need more attention. I can experiment with the
drawings wrapping around the head of the charaters, with a random-path
narrative, and try out moving the camera, etc. I need to see how WEBGL
works or if it crashes too much with my files. Then I’ll consider if its
needed to port to Love2d, Blender’s <a
href="https://upbge.org/#/">UPBGE</a> game engine (that <a
href="https://www.daniellebrathwaiteshirley.com/">Danielle
Brathwaite-Shirley</a> told me she uses and likes), or maybe Godot.
Hmmm. I also want to play with Pure Data/Plug Data, and play more
modular synth, and work on Solar Sounders with <a
href="http://dfiction.com/">Daniel</a>. And the handheld PockChip. And
my podcast! So much I can play with during the winter break. Ok, going
to go read in bed.</p>
<p>Coming back a couple hours later. I tried setting up the <a
href="https://swordsoffreeport.com/">Swords of Freeport</a>
door-game/MUD-like on the tilde server. I hope I set it up right for
other players. I tried it myself and played for a bit. It’s fun.</p>
<h2 id="dec-14">Dec 14</h2>
<p>I checked out <a
href="https://github.com/robbielyman/seamstress">Seamstress</a> art
engine, which you program in Lua, and uses Love2d, Zig and Lua under the
hood to allow the user to program small art and music sketches, kind of
like little guitar pedal effects and patches I think, but the workflow
seems to mostly revolve around Monome Grid or midi, neither of which I
use, and I couldn’t find any other starter code. I moved on and checked
out <a href="http://2484.de/yabasic/">yabasic</a>, and I like how
flexible it is. I don’t immediately have a project in it, but I was
looking around for FutureBasic (which I purchased for my birthday as a
kid) and was looking into whether there were any Basic variants that
allow functions, for example, and came across yabasic. It’s modern and
minimal, cross-platform, and includes visual libraries and socket
libraries, so this could be something cool to work with.</p>
<p>Then I spent time working in audio editing to prep for integration
with my p5.js code. I need to separate out an interview I did with my
mom last month into separate voice tracks. The audio source is only
about 20 minutes long, so I decided that rather than edit, since I
didn’t know what <em>shape</em> things will take, I would first just try
to test how things/look sound when the audio and visual sketch are
combined together. To complete, I first duped the audio and used
audacity to cut out my mom’s voice from my own audio track and exported
it. Then I began work to separate my voice from my mom’s audio track. I
didn’t quite finish yet, probably tomorrow. Now I have to head to the
rhizome fair and then the sauna night and holiday party at my art
collective, so probably no more code or project work today.</p>
<h2 id="dec-15">Dec 15</h2>
<p>Today I got back to working on the project in p5.js. When I cut off
yesterday I hadn’t yet solved an issue with detecting volume level
separately. I always advise my students to pull out the problem section
of code and try to isolate it and debug it. So I did that, and showed my
partner. And talking it through together and looking at the old p5.sound
reference I found I was using the wrong method to set the amplitude.
Well with that knowledge I made a successful <a
href="https://editor.p5js.org/2sman/sketches/llqCyQB27">test p5
sketch</a> through the web editor to demonstrate tracking two different
voice files. So now I could apply that to my main project and quickly
had success of a sorts.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">screenshot of early demo of “hyphenated
heads”, in p5.js/WEBGL</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I got to a first test point. I have two heads load, and they start to
have a conversation. I don’t think it’s particularly visually compelling
or a complete anything yet, but here’s my open studio and you’re poking
your head around checking out what I have piled up on the floor. Here it
is. Oof, must have audio capture mis-configured. It sounds like I
recorded audio routed out, captured back in by the mic! No idea.</p>
<p>The conversation is one I recorded between my mother and I a couple
weeks ago. I interview her about our family name, why we changed it, and
intersections with our culture, feminism, and equality. This demo
capture below is just the first half a minute, while I’m testing moving
the camera around. The background is blank, and our heads are fairly
simplified. I think all of this will change, but it’s meant to be a
start for me to evaluate whether this is even fruitful to pursue as a
project I envisioned in my head originally about a year ago.</p>

</iframe>
<p>I watched for a while. I need to do some minor audio edits but
Audacity glitched out. I think my running the sketch takes up lots of
memory. I need to look into it further. But I’ll say that my thought
that this is a compelling approach to telling the story seemed to ‘work’
or at least seemed like a promising approach. But having just the lips
move and occasional eye movement is missing some of the ‘natural’
feeling needed. The heads are fake but with the recorded voice it
approaches an uncanny valley. I added in occasional head tilts a bit,
because we’re missing the natural body movements with the floating heads
without bodies. This helped a bit. I’m wondering if next I should add in
something like the TV style 3 camera approach, strait ahead, 2/3 view,
and entire scene. I also wondered if the heads should be looking at each
other directly or if this angled for an audience view worked better.
When I interviewed my mom I looked directly at her. When I interview for
a podcast in person we sit at an angle together. Maybe adding switching
camera views could add something. Perhaps even looking out from
someone’s eyes. I am also confirming the background blank doesn’t work
well. I want there to be a complex, changing background. I’m worried
I’ll run out of memory and should have moved to Godot or Love/g3d. In
any case, things are moving forward and I like the approach.</p>
<div id="current">

<h2 id="dec-16">Dec 16</h2>
<p>More work on the “hyphenated” project. That’s just a working title. I
added glasses and eyebrows. A more normal person would sculpt this but I
made it out of 3d primitives (torus and cylinders) and a ton of rotation
and translation commands. A bit goofy. A dozen or two lines of code. And
lots of experimentation to get angles and such right. But it works. I
also did some tests trying to add in occasional eyebrow movement. For
example, I mapped louder volume levels of my voice to trigger an
additional rotation of my eyebrows upward for a split second. But I
couldn’t quite get to anything that looked visually compelling. I had
these little glitches get introduced and my mom’s head disappeard. I
might come back to that. Next I spent some time looking for some
patterns to wrap around the heads and use in the background -
specifically early cultural wallpapers, blockprints and other patterns
from early yiddishkeit community in NY, looking on the New York Public
Library site and some other archives but didn’t find what I’m looking
for. I was thinking I could make a simple panning background like I did
for the <a href="https://leetusman.com/bokjoy/">bokjoy</a> performance
toy I made for the Roots Studio fashion show in the spring. I’ll need to
spend more time during my winter break investigating image sources. I’m
wondering if I want to connect this small-ish story piece to the idea
that the word glitch potentially comes from <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glitch#Etymology">early German or
Jewish immigrants</a>. If so, switching between old prints and patterns
and then ‘glitch’ aesthetic might be a nice addition.</p>

<h2 id="preamble-and-planning">Preamble and Planning</h2>
<p>I’m excited for <a href="https://eli.li/december-adventure">December
Adventure</a> 2024, where I’ll code a bit every day of the month and
write about it. Last year <a
href="https://leetusman.com/december-adventure-2023">I participated</a>
and worked for a month on designing a new website. When the month ended
I hadn’t finished, and I ultimately made some different design decisions
than I experimented with. But I did use a lot of the knowledge I gained,
and I learned what I didn’t want to do as well. In particular, I made
comprehensive class-free CSS stylesheets, learned about automation with
custom templates for pandoc, and developed approaches to building
galleries with flexbox. I worked on image conversion scripts, and
accessibility. I also learned about the limitations of using markdown
and bash with variables as a templating language. All of this and much
more I put to work in the class websites I made in the spring
afterwards, and finally in my <a href="https://leetusman.com">website
redesign</a> that I completed in the spring.</p>
<p>This year, I don’t have a single project but instead a number of
little things I’m interested in exploring. I probably can’t get to all
of them. And I’ll let myself wander depending on my interests.</p>
<p>Currently, these are my ideas of things to play with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Work on an experimental narrative with recorded audio and 3d assets.
Maybe in p5/WebGL, or maybe Lua</li>
<li>Make a simple 3d environment in Godot, ideally with my own hand
drawn assets</li>
<li>Try out Construct 3 for rapid game-making</li>
<li>Try out Jeffrey’s <a
href="https://aesthetic.computer">aesthetic.computer</a>.</li>
<li>Complete my claw machine roguelike in Pico-8?</li>
<li>Work on my Forth-based Processing-like little language, using
SDL/Love2d on the backend</li>
<li>revive the PocketChip, and try to see what I can do with it with its
ancient OS</li>
<li>Install alternative firmware for my Anbernic, and try adding the
Pico-8 player to it and more roms</li>
<li>Make some class sites with Hugo, possibly with Pandoc</li>
<li>Play around with LOGO again, to prep for teaching with it in
Drawing, Moving and Seeing with Code this spring</li>
</ul>
<p>I probably will only try a small handful of these, but it’s nice to
have some options in mind.</p>
<p>Okay, I’ll be back December 1. Let’s see if I stick with this color
palette!</p>

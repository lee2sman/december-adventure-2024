## Preamble and Planning

I'm excited for [December Adventure](https://eli.li/december-adventure) 2024, where I'll code a bit every day of the month and write about it. Last year [I participated](https://leetusman.com/december-adventure-2023) and worked for a month on designing a new website. When the month ended I hadn't finished, and I ultimately made some different design decisions than I experimented with. But I did use a lot of the knowledge I gained, and I learned what I didn't want to do as well. In particular, I made comprehensive class-free CSS stylesheets, learned about automation with custom templates for pandoc, and developed approaches to building galleries with flexbox. I worked on image conversion scripts, and accessibility. I also learned about the limitations of using markdown and bash with variables as a templating language. All of this and much more I put to work in the class websites I made in the spring afterwards, and finally in my [website redesign](https://leetusman.com) that I completed in the spring.

This year, I don't have a single project but instead a number of little things I'm interested in exploring. I probably can't get to all of them. And I'll let myself wander depending on my interests. 

Currently, these are my ideas of things to play with:

* Work on an experimental narrative with recorded audio and 3d assets. Maybe in p5/WebGL, or maybe Lua
* Make a simple 3d environment in Godot, ideally with my own hand drawn assets
* Try out Construct 3 for rapid game-making
* Try out Jeffrey's [aesthetic.computer](https://aesthetic.computer).
* Complete my claw machine roguelike in Pico-8?
* Work on my Forth-based Processing-like little language, using SDL/Love2d on the backend
* revive the PocketChip, and try to see what I can do with it with its ancient OS
* Install alternative firmware for my Anbernic, and try adding the Pico-8 player to it and more roms
* Make some class sites with Hugo, possibly with Pandoc
* Play around with LOGO again, to prep for teaching with it in Drawing, Moving and Seeing with Code this spring

I probably will only try a small handful of these, but it's nice to have some options in mind.

Okay, I'll be back December 1. Let's see if I stick with this color palette!
